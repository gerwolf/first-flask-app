# first-flask-app
This is my first flask app.
The instance is hosted on <a href = "https://first-flask-app-291113.ey.r.appspot.com" target="_blank">https://first-flask-app-291113.ey.r.appspot.com</a> and uses App Engine and Cloud Build on GCP.

I followed this tutorial: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-web-application-using-flask-and-deploy-it-to-the-cloud-3551c985e492/
